   abstract = {Tidewater calving glaciers can undergo large fluctuations not necessarily in direct response to climate, but rather owing to complex ice-water interactions at the glacier termini. One example of this process in Chilean Patagonia is Glaciar Jorge Montt, where two cameras were installed in February 2010, collecting up to four glacier photographs per day, until they were recovered on 22 January 2011. Ice velocities were derived from feature tracking of the geo-referenced photos, yielding a mean value of 13 ± 4 m d-1 for the whole lower part of the glacier. These velocities were compared to satellite-imagery-derived feature tracking obtained in February 2010, resulting in similar values. During the operational period of the cameras, the glacier continued to retreat (1 km), experiencing one of the highest calving fluxes ever recorded in Patagonia (2.4 km3 a-1). Comparison with previous data also revealed ice acceleration in recent years. These very high velocities are clearly a response to enhanced glacier calving activity into a deep water fjord.},

   abstract = {We have investigated the source and role of light-absorbing impurities (LAIs) deposited on the glaciers of the Olivares catchment, in Central Chile. LAIs can considerably darken (lowered albedo) the glacier surface, enhancing their melt. We combined chemical and mineralogical laboratory analyses of surface and ice core samples with field-based spectral reflectance measurements to investigate the nature and properties of such LAIs. Using remote sensing-based albedo maps, we upscaled local information to glacier-wide coverage. We then used a model to evaluate the sensitivity of surface mass balance to a change in ice and snow albedo. The across-scale surface observations in combination with ice core analysis revealed a history of over half a century of LAIs deposition. We found traces of mining residuals in glacier surface samples. The glaciers with highest mass loss in the catchment present enhanced concentrations of surface dust particles with low reflectance properties. Our results indicate that dust particles with strong light-absorbing capacity have been mobilized from mine tailings and deposited on the nearby glacier surfaces. Large-scale assessment from satellite-based observations revealed darkening (ice albedo lowering) at most investigated glacier tongues from 1989 to 2018. Glacier melt is sensitive to ice albedo. We believe that an accelerated winter and spring snow albedo decrease, partially triggered by surface impurities, might be responsible for the above-average mass loss encountered in this catchment.},

   abstract = {Glaciers in the Southern Patagonia Icefield (SPI) have been shrinking in recent decades, but due to a lack of field observations, understanding of the drivers of ablation is limited. We present a distributed surface energy balance model, forced with meteorological observations from a west-east transect located in the north of the SPI. Between October 2015 and June 2016, humid and warm on-glacier conditions prevailed on the western side compared to dry and cold conditions on the eastern side. Controls of ablation differ along the transect, although at glacier-wide scale sensible heat (mean of 72 W m-2 to the west and 51 W m-2 to the east) and net shortwave radiation (mean of 54 W m-2 to the west and 52 W m-2 to the east) provided the main energy sources. Net longwave radiation was an energy sink, while latent heat was the most spatially variable flux, being an energy sink in the east (-4 W m-2) and a source in the west (20 W m-2). Ablation was high, but at comparable elevations, it was greater to the west. These results provide new insights into the spatial variability of energy-balance fluxes and their control over the ablation of Patagonian glaciers.},

   abstract = {Climate change is associated with changes in the frequency and intensity of extreme weather events. Extreme weather is impacting the mass balance of Andean glaciers, a phenomenon that requires further detailed investigation. Among these extreme events, atmospheric rivers (ARs) play a significant role, potentially leading to either accumulation or melting events on glaciers. To assess the impact of ARs on Andean glaciers, we analysed an unseasonal event that occurred at the end of January 2021 - marked by extreme snowfall in the highlands and heavy rainfall, landslides and flash floods in the lowlands - during the typically dry austral summer period. Satellite imagery and meteorological observations in the glaciated Maipo River basin and its Olivares River sub-basin (33° S) enabled the characterisation of this event and its basin-scale impacts. Moreover, a glacier mass balance model allows us to quantify the effects of the AR on the Olivares Alfa Glacier (4284 to 4988 m a.s.l.) in the context of the preceding 6 hydrological years. The large water vapour transport by the AR led to substantial snow accumulation on the Maipo River glaciers, resulting in a post-event snow line observed at 2463 m a.s.l. In the Olivares River sub-basin, the 0 °C isotherm dropped from typical summertime altitudes of 4000-4500 m a.s.l. to 3250 m a.s.l. during the event, below the frontal zone of all glaciers in this sub-basin. The mass balance model for the Olivares Alfa Glacier during the dry 2020-2021 hydrological year showed a trend toward negative values at the beginning of the ablation season, aligned with previous years and the prevailing severe drought conditions. However, the AR snowfall event, combined with cooler conditions and other small accumulation events during the remainder of the ablation season compared to previous years, offset this trend and brought the mass balance closer to equilibrium. This demonstrates that an unseasonal snow accumulation event can significantly counteract the broader seasonal trends affecting subtropical Andean glaciers. Our study sheds light on the impacts of extreme and unseasonal snow accumulation events on glacier mass balance in the high Andes, particularly those associated with ARs, a synoptic feature projected to become more common in a warming climate.},
